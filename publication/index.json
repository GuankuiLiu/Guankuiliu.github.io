Fishing patterns in some developing countries (e.g. China, the largest producer of seafood) closely resemble BH, where catches have been highly diversified by unselective gears due to market demand for almost all species. In this study, we employed an OSMOSE ecosystem model developed for the Yellow Sea in China to investigate the potential occurrences and advantages of BH in this region with highly exploited multispecies fisheries. Simulations were carried out under four types of fishing scenarios, where various levels of fishing mortality rates for all species or specific functional groups were implemented. Results indicated that the occurrences of BH depended on fishing pressure and targeted functional groups, and that size-level BH was significantly correlated with biomass and yield for most species. In particular, varying fishing pressure for certain functional groups resulted in BH, which produced a high yield for specific species and ensured their biomass sustainability. We concluded that the benefits of BH could be potentially achieved by adjusting fishing pressure for certain functional groups based on the existing fishing pattern in over-exploited ecosystems.","authors":["Runlong Sun","Peng Sun*","Caihong Fu","Guankui Liu","Zhenlin Liang","Yunne-Jai Shin","Nicolas Barrier","Yongjun Tian"],"booktitle":null,"id":0,"publication":"ICES Journal of Marine Science","publishDate":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"Exploring balanced harvest as a potential strategy for highly exploited multispecies fisheries","uri":"https://guankuiliu.github.io/publication/article/2022_exploring-balanced-harvest-as-a-potential-strategy-for-highly-exploited-multispecies-fisheries/"},{"ENTRYTYPE":"article","abstract":"The composition of catch is affected by exploited fishing gear and its selectivity, and long-term selective harvest induces the change in biological characters and economic value of exploited population. Stow net is the main fishing gear to capture commercially important fish species small yellow croaker ( Larimichthys polyactis ) in Haizhou Bay, China. Long-term stow net selective harvest affects both the biological characters and economic benefits of small yellow croaker. Therefore, an appropriate harvest scenario that can achieve the high economic benefits and the sustainable use of resource needs to be explored. In this study, we develop a bio-economic model for small yellow croaker and focus on different harvest scenarios for obtaining maximum economic benefit and sustainable utilization of resource. Our results indicate that the increase in mesh size has positive effects on the protection of small yellow croaker population, and optimal harvest scenario achieves the short- or long-term economic benefits to different stakeholders. Fishing with small mesh size gets high economic value in short-term, while fishing with large mesh size achieves better economic value and effectively protect small yellow croaker resource under long-term fishing pressure. This study provides evidence to balance the long-term economic benefits and sustainable utilization of fishery resource, and it also offers a basis for the scientific formulation of fishery policy.","authors":["Peng Sun*","Jie Yu","Runlong Sun","Guankui Liu","Xiaoyu Xi","Yongjun Tian"],"booktitle":null,"id":1,"publication":"Frontiers in Marine Science","publishDate":"2022-03-30T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"The Effects of Selective Harvest on Exploited Population and Economic Benefits","uri":"https://guankuiliu.github.io/publication/article/2022_the-effects-of-selective-harvest-on-exploited-population-and-economic-benefits/"}]
